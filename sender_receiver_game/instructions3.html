       How does the matching of Senders and Receivers work?
    </h3>
<p>
    At the beginning of the experiment, you will be randomly allocated into groups of ten participants-five Senders
    and five Receivers. In every round of the experiment, Senders and Receivers are randomly re-matched into five pairs.
    This means that in any round, you can be matched with any Receiver in your group.
</p>

<p>
    <i>[Think it would be good to have a picture here titled “Your matching group” and then have stylized avatars of
        5 Senders and 5 Receivers.]</i>
</p>

<h3>Summary: Each round of the game goes as follows:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The computer generates a secret number.</li>
    <li>The Sender sends a message to the Receiver.</li>
    <li>The Receiver receives the message and guesses the secret number.</li>
    <li>Both of you receive feedback.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The Sender’s expected bonus is higher when the Receiver guesses a higher number.
    The Receiver’s expected bonus is higher if the guess is closer to the secret number.
    The Sender doesn't know the secret number when they send the message.
    The Receiver knows the Sender doesn't know the secret number.
</p>

<p>
    The experiment ends after <b>{{Constants.num_rounds}}</b> of the game.
