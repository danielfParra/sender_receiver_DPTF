       How does the matching of Player As and Player Bs work?
    </h3>
<p>
    At the beginning of the experiment, you will be randomly allocated into groups of ten participants-five Player As
    and five Player Bs. In every round of the experiment, Player As and Player Bs are randomly re-matched into five pairs.
    This means that in any round, you can be matched with any Player B in your group.
</p>

<p>
    <i>[Think it would be good to have a picture here titled “Your matching group” and then have stylized avatars of
        5 Player As and 5 Player Bs.]</i>
