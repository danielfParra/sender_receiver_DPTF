       How does the matching of Player As and Player Bs work?
    </h3>
<p>
    At the beginning of the experiment, you will be randomly allocated into groups of ten participants-five Player As
    and five Player Bs. In every round of the experiment, Player As and Player Bs are randomly re-matched into five pairs.
    This means that in any round, you can be matched with any Player B in your group.
</p>

<p>
    <i>[Think it would be good to have a picture here titled “Your matching group” and then have stylized avatars of
        5 Player As and 5 Player Bs.]</i>
</p>

<h3>Summary: Each round of the game goes as follows:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The computer generates a secret number.</li>
    <li>The Player A sends a message to the Player B.</li>
    <li>The Player B receives the message and guesses the secret number.</li>
    <li>Both of you receive feedback.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The Player A’s expected bonus is higher when the Player B guesses a higher number.
    The Player B’s expected bonus is higher if the guess is closer to the secret number.
    The Player A doesn't know the secret number when they send the message.
    The Player B knows the Player A doesn't know the secret number.
</p>

<p>
    The experiment ends after <b>{{Constants.num_rounds}}</b> of the game.
