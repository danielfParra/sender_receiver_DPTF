       How does the matching of Player As and Player Bs work?
    </h3>
<p>
    At the beginning of the experiment, you will be randomly allocated into <b>groups of ten participants</b>&mdash;five Player As
    and five Player Bs. In every round of the experiment, Player As and Player Bs are <b>randomly re-matched into five pairs.</b>
    This means that in any round, any Player A in your matching group can be matched with any Player B in your matching group.
</p>

<p>
    The matching for each round is done by the computer.
    The computer will randomly select a Player A and a Player B to create each group.
    For an illustration see the video below.
