        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        Today, you will be randomly paired with another participant to play a game.
        The computer has randomly assigned you the role of <b>Player A or Player B,</b> which you will keep for
        the <b>{{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds of the experiment.</b>
        We will tell you your role on the next screen. In each round, if you are a Player A,
        you will be randomly matched with a Player B, and vice versa. <b>Your partner will change randomly from
        one round to the next.</b> Neither of you will know the identity of the other, and all interactions will
        be anonymized by the computers.
    </p>

    <h3>
         General description of the game
    </h3>

 <p>
     <br>
    Each round of the game has <b>four steps.</b>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The computer generates a <b>secret number</b>, which is <b>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Player A sends a <b>message</b> to Player B saying <b>"The secret number is X."</b>
        <b>Player A can choose any number</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 for X. For example, if Player A chooses “2”,
        Player B will receive the message "The secret number is 2." <b>While choosing</b> which message to send,
        <b>Player A does not know the secret number.</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Player B <b>observes</b> the <b>message</b> and <b>guesses the secret number.</b>
        Player B can <b>guess any number</b> between 1 and 6, including two-digit numbers.
        For example, a Player B who thinks that 1 and 2 are equally likely can guess 1.50, and a Player B
        who thinks that the secret number is either 4 or 5 but most likely 5 can make a guess between
        4 and 5 but closer to 5, such as 4.8.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Both Player A and Player B will receive <b>feedback.</b>
        This feedback will include the secret number, the original message, and the recipient's guess.
    </li>
</ol>

    <b> How does the computer generate the secret number?</b> <br>
    You can think of the computer as a device that randomly selects one of
    six balls from an urn that are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
</p>

 <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <img src="{% static 'global/urn.png' %}" alt="Urn Image" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 200px;">
 </div>
<br>


<p>
    As the urn contains one ball of each number, the <b>probability of generating any given
    number between 1 and 6 is equal.</b> Consequently, in the absence of any information,
    <b>you can reasonably assume</b> that the secret number will, <b>on average, be equal to 3.5.</b>
</p>
<p>
    These draws are <b>completely independent</b> across rounds. This means that you should <b>not strategize</b>
    about the value of the secret number based on the value of secret number in a previous round.
