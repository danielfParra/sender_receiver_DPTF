        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        Today, you will be randomly paired with another participant to play a game.
        The computer has randomly assigned you the role of Sender or Receiver, which you will keep for
        the <b>{{ Constants.num_rounds }}</b> rounds of the experiment.
        We will tell you your role on the next screen. In each round, if you are a Sender,
        you will be randomly matched with a Receiver, and vice versa. Your partner will change randomly from
        one round to the next. Neither of you will know the identity of the other, and all interactions will
        be anonymized by the computers.
    </p>

         General description of the game
    </h3>

 <p>
     <br>
    Each round of the game has four steps.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The computer generates a secret number, which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Sender sends a message to the Receiver saying "The secret number is X."
        The Sender can choose any 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 for X. For example, if the Sender chooses “2”,
        the Receiver will receive the message "The secret number is 2." While choosing which message to send,
        the Sender does not know the secret number.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Receiver observes the message and guesses the secret number.
        The receiver can guess any number between 0 and 6, including two-digit numbers.
        For example, a Receiver who thinks that 1 and 2 are equally likely can guess 1.50, and a Receiver
        who thinks that the secret number is either 4 or 5 but most likely 5 can make a guess between
        4 and 5 but closer to 5, such as 4.8.
    </li>
    <li>
        Both the Sender and the Receiver will receive feedback.
        This feedback will include the secret number, the original message, and the recipient's guess.
    </li>
</ol>

    <b> How does the computer generate the secret number?</b>
    You can think of the computer as a device that randomly selects one of
    seven balls from an urn that are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
</p>

<p>
    [Picture of urn]
</p>

<p>
    As the urn contains one ball of each number, the probability of generating any given
    number between 0 and 6 is equal. Consequently, in the absence of any information,
    you reasonably assumed that the secret number will, on average, be equal to 3.5.
    These draws are completely independent across rounds. This means that you should not strategize
    about the value of the secret number based on the value of secret number in a previous round.
