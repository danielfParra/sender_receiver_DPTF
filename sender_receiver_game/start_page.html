        We will now start the game. In each round, you will have <b>{{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds time</b> to
        choose your message for Player B. Player B will then have {{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds
        time to make a guess. After Player B makes a guess, you will observe feedback for 5 seconds.
        Then, a new round starts.

    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Make sure that you choose your message within the {{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds allotted to you.
        If you do not choose your message in time, your payoff for this round will be zero!
