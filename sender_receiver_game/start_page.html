        We will now start the game. In each round, you will have {{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds time to
        choose your message to the Receiver. The Receiver will then have {{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds
        time to make a guess. After the Receiver makes a guess, you will observe feedback for 5 seconds.
        Then, a new round starts.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Make sure that you choose your message within the 20 seconds allotted to you.
        If you do not choose your message in time, your payoff for this round will be zero!
