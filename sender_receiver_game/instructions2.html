        How will the payoffs be determined?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Of the <b>{{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds</b> of the experiment, the computer will randomly choose <b>half of them,</b>
        which will be considered <b>relevant</b> for the determination of <b>your payoffs.</b>
        If a round is randomly chosen to be payoff-relevant,
        this means that this round will <b>count towards your earnings.</b> Otherwise, it will not.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will <b>never know</b> whether the current round is <b>payoff-relevant for you</b>. However, <b>you will be</b> able to see whether the <b>current round is payoff-relevant for your counterpart.</b> You can only influence the counterpart’s earnings when it is their payoff-relevant round.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Which rounds are payoff-relevant for Player A and Player B is <b>determined independently.</b> This means that knowing whether the current round is payoff-relevant for your counterpart does not imply that it is more or less likely that the current round is payoff-relevant for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each payoff-relevant round, the payoffs are as follows:
    </p>

    <h3>
         Player A’s payoff:
    </h3>

 <p>
    <b>Player A</b> can earn a bonus of <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b> depending on Player B’s guess in this round.
     In particular, the <b>probability of Player A earning the {{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos bonus</b> is <b>increasing</b> in
     <b>Player B’s guess.</b> The higher Player B’s guess is, the more likely it is that Player A will win
     <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Simply put, Player A will earn more if Player B guesses a higher number.

    Player B’s guess is a number between 1 and 6. This number is used to determine
            Player A’s payoff according to the following formula:
</p>

<div class="card bg-light my-3">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 0.8rem;">
      <b>Probability of Player A receiving {{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos (in percent)=</b>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
        <math>
  <mfrac>
    <mrow>
      <mi>Player&nbsp;B's&nbsp;guess&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</mi>
    </mrow>
    <mn>5</mn>
  </mfrac>
  <mo>&times;</mo>
  <mn>100</mn>
        </math>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>
    The formula takes the difference between Player B’s guess and 6. The resulting number
    is divided by 5 and then multiplied by 100. 
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that Player B’s guess is equal to 6. In this case, the difference is 5,
    and Player A’s probability of winning the bonus is 100%. In contrast, when Player B’s guess is 1,
    the difference is equal to 0. This implies that Player A’s probability of winning the bonus is 0%.
</p>

<p>
    The principle underlying the formula is simple: The closer Player B’s guess is to the highest possible guess,
    the higher the chance that Player A receives a payoff of <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b>.

    Player B’s payoff:

    Player B can also earn a bonus of <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b> depending on the accuracy

    Simply put, Player B earns more when they guess a number closer to the secret number.

<p>
    The formula takes the square of the difference between Player B’s guess and the secret number.
    The resulting number is multiplied by a constant and then subtracted from 100.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that Player B’s guess is exactly equal to the secret number.
    In this case, the difference is zero, and Player B’s chance of winning the bonus is 100%.
    As Player B’s guess moves away from the true value of the secret number,
    the difference becomes larger, which decreases the probability of winning the bonus.
</p>

<p>
    The principle underlying the formula is simple: The closer Player B’s guess is to the secret number,
    the higher the chance that Player B receives a payoff of <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b>.
