        How will the payoffs be determined?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Of the {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds of the experiment, the computer will randomly choose half of them,
        which will be considered relevant for the determination of your payoffs.
        If a round is randomly chosen to be payoff-relevant,
        this means that this round will count towards your earnings.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each payoff-relevant round, the payoffs are as follows:
    </p>

      <p>
        <input id="info_button2" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button2, paragraph2);" />

    <h3>
         Sender’s payoff:
    </h3>

 <p>
    The Sender can earn a bonus of <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b> depending on the Receiver’s guess in this round.
     In particular, the probability of earning the <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b> bonus is increasing in the
     Receiver’s guess. The higher the Receiver’s guess is, the more likely it is that the Sender will win
     <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Simply put, the Sender will earn more if the Receiver guesses a higher number.

    The Receiver’s guess is a number between 0 and 6. This number is used to determine
            the Sender’s payoff according to the following formula:
</p>

<div class="card bg-light my-3">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1rem;">
      <b>Probability of the Sender receiving {{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos (in percent):</b>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">
      100 - &#40;100 / 36&#41; &times; &#40;6 - Receiver's guess&#41;<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>
    The formula takes the square of the difference between the Receiver’s guess and 6. The resulting number
    is multiplied by a constant and then subtracted from 100.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that the Receiver’s guess is equal to 6. In this case, the difference is zero,
    and the Sender’s probability of winning the bonus is 100%. In contrast, when the Receiver’s guess is 0,
    the squared difference is equal to 36. This implies that the Sender’s probability of winning the bonus is 0%.
</p>

<p>
    The principle underlying the formula is simple: The closer the Receiver’s guess is to the highest possible guess,
    the higher the chance that the Sender receives a payoff of <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b>.

<h3>
    Receiver’s payoff:
</h3>
<p>
    The Receiver can also earn a bonus of <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b> depending on the accuracy
    of their guess. In particular, the probability of the Receiver earning the
    <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b> bonus increases with the accuracy of the Receiver’s guess.
    The more accurate the guess is, the more likely it is that the Receiver will win <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Simply put, the Receiver earns more when they guess a number closer to the secret number.

    The Receiver’s guess is a number between <b>0 and 6</b>.

<p>
    Suppose that the Receiver’s guess is exactly equal to the secret number.
    In this case, the difference is zero, and the Receiver’s chance of winning the bonus is 100%.
    As the Receiver’s guess moves away from the true value of the secret number,
    the difference becomes larger, which decreases the probability of winning the bonus.

    The principle underlying the formula is simple: The closer the Receiver’s guess is to the secret number,
