        How will the payoffs be determined?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Of the {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds of the experiment, the computer will randomly choose half of them,
        which will be considered relevant for the determination of your payoffs.
        If a round is randomly chosen to be payoff-relevant,
        this means that this round will count towards your earnings.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each payoff-relevant round, the payoffs are as follows:
    </p>

      <p>
        <input id="info_button2" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button2, paragraph2);" />

    <h3>
         Player A’s payoff:
    </h3>

 <p>
    The Player A can earn a bonus of <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b> depending on the Player B’s guess in this round.
     In particular, the probability of earning the <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b> bonus is increasing in the
     Player B’s guess. The higher the Player B’s guess is, the more likely it is that the Player A will win
     <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Simply put, the Player A will earn more if the Player B guesses a higher number.

    The Player B’s guess is a number between 1 and 6. This number is used to determine
            the Player A’s payoff according to the following formula:
</p>

<div class="card bg-light my-3">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1rem;">
      <b>Probability of the Player A receiving {{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos (in percent):</b>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">
      <b>(Player B's guess - 1) / 5 * 100</b>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>
    The formula takes the square of the difference between the Player B’s guess and 6. The resulting number
    is multiplied by a constant and then subtracted from 100.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that the Player B’s guess is equal to 6. In this case, the difference is zero,
    and the Player A’s probability of winning the bonus is 100%. In contrast, when the Player B’s guess is 1,
    the squared difference is equal to 25. This implies that the Player A’s probability of winning the bonus is 0%.
</p>

<p>
    The principle underlying the formula is simple: The closer the Player B’s guess is to the highest possible guess,
    the higher the chance that the Player A receives a payoff of <b>{{Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT}} pesos</b>.

<h3>
    Player B’s payoff:
</h3>
<p>
    The Player B can also earn a bonus of <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b> depending on the accuracy
    of their guess. In particular, the probability of the Player B earning the
    <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b> bonus increases with the accuracy of the Player B’s guess.
    The more accurate the guess is, the more likely it is that the Player B will win <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Simply put, the Player B earns more when they guess a number closer to the secret number.

    The Player B’s guess is a number between <b>1 and 6</b>.

<p>
    The formula takes the square of the difference between the Player B’s guess and the secret number.

<p>
    Suppose that the Player B’s guess is exactly equal to the secret number.
    In this case, the difference is zero, and the Player B’s chance of winning the bonus is 100%.
    As the Player B’s guess moves away from the true value of the secret number,
    the difference becomes larger, which decreases the probability of winning the bonus.
</p>

<p>
    The principle underlying the formula is simple: The closer the Player B’s guess is to the secret number,
    the higher the chance that the Player B receives a payoff of <b>{{ Constants.BONUS_AMOUNT }} pesos</b>.
